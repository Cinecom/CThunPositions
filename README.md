**VERSION**

Created with â™¥ by Horyoshi for World of Warcraft 1.12 - tested and working for TurtleWoW


**ABOUT**

This AddOn shows a map of the final boss room in AQ40: C'Thun. Anyone with the addon installed will see the names of all raidmembers in the map. They can drag the names around to position each player, take a screenshot of it and share on Discord so that everyone knows where to stand during phase 1 of the fight.


**HOW TO**

Unzip the file and place the 'CThunPositions' folder in your /Interface/AddOns folder. **Remove '-master' from the folder name!**

1. Click the mini-map icon to open/close the C'Thun map
2. Drag the playernames to where you want them to stand
3. Make a screenshot, share on Discord and tell everyone to look at it
4. Kill C'Thun
